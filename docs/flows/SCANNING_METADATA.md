# Scanning, filesystems, metadata and catalogue writes

This guide follows a manual or automatic catalogue scan. This is one of the
highest-risk areas because an incorrect change can misclassify a temporarily
unavailable source as deleted media.

## Entry paths

A scan can be requested through the plug-in UI or scheduled by the service:

```text
manual action in views.py ─┐
                           ├→ Scanner.scan_sources()
automatic service scan ────┘
```

Both paths create the same scanner with a catalogue, filesystem, settings,
cancellation callback, progress callbacks and checkpoint store.

Widget routes never start scans.

## Main scan flow

```text
Scanner.scan_sources(optional source ids)
→ load enabled sources
→ acquire shared scan lock
→ prepare compatible local checkpoint
→ skip sources already completed in that checkpoint
→ Scanner.scan_source(source)
   → verify source root
   → restore folder stack or start at root
   → list directories through CancellationAwareFilesystem
   → upsert folder
   → stat supported media files
   → reuse unchanged rows or extract metadata
   → insert/update media and search document
   → commit completed folder
   → save atomic checkpoint
   → after complete traversal, mark unseen rows missing
   → update folder summaries
→ complete checkpoint
→ release scan lock
→ report statistics
```

## Files and responsibilities

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `scanner.py` | Traversal, locks, cancellation, changed-file decisions and writes |
| `filesystem.py` | Kodi VFS/local I/O abstraction and cancellation-aware wrapper |
| `metadata.py` | EXIF, XMP and optional IPTC extraction and normalization |
| `models.py` | Source, file stat, metadata and scan-stat structures |
| `scan_checkpoint.py` | Compatible resumable folder state in the local profile |
| `db/catalog.py` | Source, folder, media, tag, search-document and scan-run writes |
| `db/locks.py` | Named lock constants and lock support |
| `views.py` | Manual scan action and progress presentation |
| `service_loop.py` | Automatic scheduling and playback-aware scan behaviour |
| `kodi.py` | Shared scan status, cancellation and background progress adapters |

## Source safety

A source has three distinct situations:

1. **Unavailable root**: do not traverse and do not mark existing rows missing.
2. **Partial traversal**: keep successful writes, report partial status and do
   not mark unseen rows missing.
3. **Complete, non-cancelled traversal**: unseen rows may be soft-marked
   missing after the traversal completes.

This distinction is required for SMB, NFS and NAS use. An empty result from a
failed listing is not evidence that a folder is genuinely empty.

## Scan lock

`Scanner` obtains a named catalogue lock before scanning. The lock has an owner
identifier and time-to-live. Long scans refresh it periodically, including
around filesystem activity. If refresh proves that ownership was lost, the scan
must stop rather than continue writing under a false assumption of exclusivity.

The lock matters especially for a shared MySQL/MariaDB catalogue used by more
than one Kodi device.

## Cancellation

Cancellation is cooperative and safe:

- Kodi or the user requests a stop;
- the scanner checks at file/folder boundaries and through the wrapped
  filesystem;
- current bounded I/O can finish;
- the scan records cancellation and preserves a compatible checkpoint;
- missing marking is skipped for unfinished traversal.

Do not replace this with forceful thread termination or a cancellation check
that occurs only between whole sources.

## Checkpoints

Checkpoints are local to each Kodi profile, even when the catalogue is shared.
They record the folder stack and accumulated statistics after fully completed
folders.

A checkpoint is reused only if relevant inputs are unchanged, including:

- enabled source selection;
- database identity;
- picture/video extensions;
- exclusions;
- metadata settings that affect indexing.

When changing scanner inputs, update checkpoint compatibility tests so that a
stale checkpoint cannot skip files that have become newly eligible.

## Metadata path

For a changed picture:

```text
media URI
→ Filesystem.stat()
→ metadata.extract_metadata()
→ bounded/materialized read when required
→ EXIF values
→ embedded XMP values
→ optional IPTC values for JPEG
→ normalized MetadataResult
→ scanner record
→ Catalog.insert_picture() or update_picture()
→ tags and normalized search document
```

For optional video rows, the scanner uses MIME inference and file modification
time rather than a full video metadata scraper.

## Unchanged files

The scanner compares stored size and modification information before reading
metadata again. An unchanged item is touched as seen without repeating
expensive metadata work. Changes to the unchanged-file rule can have large
performance and correctness effects on NAS libraries and require regression
tests.

## Missing records and cleanup

Missing marking is soft. Rows are retained for the configured period. A
separate cleanup action deletes old missing rows. Do not combine source scanning
with immediate irreversible deletion.

## Useful tests

- `tests/test_scanner.py`;
- `tests/test_background_source_scan.py`;
- `tests/test_scan_checkpoint.py`;
- `tests/test_service_scan_progress.py`;
- service cancellation and shutdown tests;
- `tests/test_metadata.py`;
- `tests/test_catalog.py`;
- `tests/test_database_busy_handling.py`;
- `tests/test_mysql_integration.py` for shared-backend changes.

Search the suite for `partial`, `missing`, `checkpoint`, `cancel` and
`acquire_lock` before changing this flow.

## Invariants

- Never mark unseen media missing after an unavailable or partial traversal.
- Keep cleanup separate from scanning.
- Preserve cancellation around slow filesystem and metadata operations.
- Preserve scan-lock refresh and ownership checks.
- Commit checkpoints only after a folder is fully processed.
- Force a fresh traversal when settings change what can be discovered.
- Avoid copying complete remote files when a bounded read is sufficient.
- Add a real-Kodi or NAS validation note for behaviour that stubs cannot prove.

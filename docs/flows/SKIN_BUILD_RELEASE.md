# Estuary integration, builds, GitHub Actions and releases

This guide covers the optional Estuary MyPicsDB 3 skin, generated packages and
the GitHub workflows that validate and publish them.

## Source and generated content

The repository does not commit a complete copied Estuary source tree.
Instead it stores:

```text
contrib/estuary/upstream.json     pinned official Kodi releases
contrib/estuary/patches/...       maintained MyPicsDB 3 changes
```

The build process:

```text
pinned official Estuary archive
→ extract skin.estuary only
→ change add-on id
→ add MyPicsDB 3 dependency
→ apply maintained Pictures-home patches
→ verify generated skin
→ package per Kodi channel
```

Generated skin source under `build/` and downloaded archives under `.cache/`
are intentionally excluded from Git history.

## Main files

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `contrib/estuary/upstream.json` | Official release pins and independent skin versions |
| `contrib/estuary/patches/` | Maintained skin modifications |
| `tools/estuary_skin.py` | Fetch/extract/patch logic |
| `tools/update_estuary_upstreams.py` | Finds newer official release pins |
| `tools/build.py` | Creates packages, checksums and Kodi repository tree |
| `repository.mypicsdb3/` | Kodi repository add-on metadata |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Python matrix, tests, full build and add-on checker |
| `.github/workflows/mariadb.yml` | Shared-database integration test |
| `.github/workflows/pages.yml` | Published Kodi repository on GitHub Pages |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Tagged release assets |
| `.github/workflows/estuary-upstream.yml` | Scheduled verified upstream refresh |

## Widget and skin contract

MyPicsDB 3 exposes stable provider URLs and preferences that skins can read.
The maintained Estuary fork consumes that contract to show picture rows on the
Pictures home screen.

Before changing a provider URL, label, artwork property, row limit or preference
serialization, read:

- `docs/WIDGET_URLS.md`;
- `docs/SKIN_INTEGRATION.md`;
- `docs/ESTUARY_INTEGRATION.md`.

A provider change may be a public integration change even when the Python edit
looks small.

## Local builds

Normal verification without an Estuary download:

```bash
python3 tools/verify.py
python3 -m pytest
python3 tools/build.py --skip-skin
```

Full current-channel build:

```bash
python3 tools/build.py
```

Offline/local upstream source for one channel:

```bash
python3 tools/build.py --channel omega --estuary-source /path/to/skin.estuary
```

The build writes archives and a repository tree under `dist/`.

## GitHub Actions after a push

For a branch or pull request:

1. Open the pull request's **Checks** section or repository **Actions** tab.
2. Confirm the **CI** Python matrix is green.
3. Confirm **MariaDB integration** is green.
4. For skin/build changes, inspect the Python 3.11 build and add-on checker
   steps and download the workflow artifact when manual package testing is
   needed.
5. Correct failures in a new commit on the same branch.

For `main`, the normal workflows repeat the checks. Pages or scheduled Estuary
workflows run according to their own triggers.

## Release flow

A release is intentional and tag-driven:

```text
update versions and changelog
→ run tests, verification and full build
→ commit and push main
→ wait for main workflows to pass
→ create annotated v<version> tag
→ push tag
→ release workflow rebuilds and attaches assets
```

The plug-in, repository add-on, Estuary skin, database schema and Query Model
have different versions. Change only the version that belongs to the modified
contract.

## Scheduled upstream refresh

The Estuary updater checks for newer official release pins. When a pin changes,
GitHub Actions applies the maintained patch, verifies, tests, builds and runs
the add-on checker before committing the pin. On failure it leaves the existing
published repository in place and reports the problem for manual review.

Do not manually accept a new upstream pin merely because it downloads. The
patched home screen and both supported Kodi channels must still build and test.

## Useful tests

- `tests/test_estuary_skin.py`;
- `tests/test_estuary_updater.py`;
- `tests/test_repository_assets.py`;
- `tests/test_home_layout_editor.py`;
- `tests/test_home_screen_settings.py`;
- `tests/test_settings_display.py`;
- relevant UI/widget tests.

## Invariants

- Generated official Estuary files are not committed.
- Upstream tags and hashes remain pinned and reviewable.
- Both supported Kodi channels are built where the workflow requires them.
- Public widget URLs remain stable or are documented as compatibility changes.
- Repository artwork paths and manifests remain valid.
- A release tag is created only after the exact main commit is green.
- The repository add-on version changes only when that add-on changes.

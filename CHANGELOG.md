# Changelog

## 0.2.37 - 2026-07-27

- Keep Kodi's native recursive slideshow for picture-only album trees, but use
  the bounded MyPicsDB picture playlist when the selected album tree contains
  indexed videos.
- Reuse the scoped mixed-video monitor for mixed album playback so video-to-
  picture transitions are handled only for explicitly started mixed playlists.
- Make the add-on's **Debug logging** setting visible in `kodi.log` without
  requiring Kodi's global debug mode, and add route, media-count, playlist-batch
  and monitor-state diagnostics.
- Keep database schema 5 and repository add-on version 0.2.26 unchanged.

## 0.2.36 - 2026-07-27

- Wait until the requested picture container has remained active long enough for
  Kodi's path-specific view state to begin settling.
- Apply the configured album view synchronously, verify the active view control
  and retry only when Kodi performs a late restore to Shift or another saved view.
- Cancel retries when the user navigates away, preserving the parent menu view.
- Keep widgets, the main menu and database schema 5 unchanged.

## 0.2.35 - 2026-07-27

- Apply the configured album view only after Kodi reports that the requested
  picture container is active.
- Match both the plug-in category and content type before sending
  `Container.SetViewMode`, preventing search and saved-search results from
  changing the parent MyPicsDB 3 menu view.
- Stop using immediate duplicate view-mode commands; time out without touching
  another container when Kodi does not expose the expected result view.
- Keep widgets, the main menu and database schema 5 unchanged.

## 0.2.34 - 2026-07-27

- Add **Saved searches** to the add-on menu and allow the current global text
  search to be saved, reopened with normal pagination and slideshow support,
  renamed or deleted.
- Add database schema 5 with a portable `saved_searches` table for SQLite and
  MySQL/MariaDB. Store canonical Query Model JSON and its explicit version, not
  raw SQL or query JSON in saved-view plugin URLs.
- Revalidate the stored query version, JSON structure, fields and operators
  every time a saved search is opened.

## 0.2.33 - 2026-07-27

- Build large database-backed slideshows in bounded JSON-RPC batches instead of
  sending up to 5,000 media paths in one oversized `Playlist.Add` request.
- Drop empty and duplicate media URIs while preserving catalogue order and
  recalculate **Play slideshow from here** against the cleaned playlist.
- Keep the mixed-video monitor inactive while the playlist is being assembled,
  arm it only after playback starts successfully, and clear a partially built
  playlist when Kodi rejects an add or open request.
- Keep native recursive album slideshows unchanged and retain database schema 4.

## 0.2.32 - 2026-07-27

- Prefer the newest eligible picture as artwork for recent, random and folder
  album rows, even when a newer video exists in the same album.
- Keep the newest media timestamps for recent-album ordering instead of letting
  the picture-first artwork choice change album recency.
- Fall back to video artwork for albums that contain no pictures.
- Keep database schema 4 and avoid modifying original media.

## 0.2.31 - 2026-07-27

- Treat a directory-listing failure as an incomplete source traversal and skip
  missing-file and missing-folder marking for that source.
- Keep previously indexed media active when a listed file temporarily fails
  stat or metadata access.
- Record incomplete scans with the explicit `partial` status while continuing
  to index media from folders that were read successfully.
- Mark genuine deletions on the next complete scan without changing database
  schema 4.

## 0.2.30 - 2026-07-27

- Treat a migration lock held by another MyPicsDB 3 process as a temporary
  database-busy state instead of exposing a plug-in failure.
- Show a clear retry message for interactive browser requests while allowing
  widgets to return a successful, uncached empty directory without a popup.
- Let the background service wait briefly and retry database initialization,
  while still stopping promptly when Kodi is shutting down.
- Keep other migration and database failures visible instead of hiding them
  behind the temporary-busy handling.

## 0.2.29 - 2026-07-27

- Run the mixed-slideshow video monitor only while an explicitly started
  database-backed MyPicsDB 3 playlist contains video.
- Keep native recursive album slideshows free from MyPicsDB 3 JSON-RPC polling
  and automatic `Player.GoTo` calls.
- Clear stale mixed-slideshow session state after playback stops, while allowing
  a short startup grace period before Kodi reports an active player.

## 0.2.28 - 2026-07-27

- Use Kodi's native recursive folder slideshow when starting a slideshow from an
  album, allowing Kodi to handle picture/video transitions and consecutive
  videos directly.
- Keep the database-backed mixed playlist for result sets that can span
  unrelated folders, such as searches and other catalogue views.
- Avoid the rapid MJPEG playback and difficult-to-stop sequence seen when the
  custom mixed-slideshow video monitor was disabled during diagnosis.

## 0.2.27 - 2026-07-26

- Keep the repository add-on on its own version instead of bumping it for every
  MyPicsDB 3 plug-in release, preventing Kodi from replacing the repository
  while it is being used for an update check.
- Reuse the exact previously published repository archive when its version and
  contents are unchanged, and fail the Pages build if repository files change
  without a version bump.
- Do not attach an unchanged repository zip to plug-in-only GitHub releases.

## 0.2.26 - 2026-07-26

- Bump the Estuary MyPicsDB 3 skin package revisions so Kodi installs the
  home-screen XML added in 0.2.24.
- Ensure **On this day** and **On this day - random** can both appear when both
  rows are enabled. Existing installations update from skin 21.3.5 to 21.3.6
  on Kodi 21.3.

## 0.2.25 - 2026-07-26

- Treat Kodi's early `System.OnQuit` and `System.OnRestart` notifications as
  immediate cancellation signals for the service and manual scans.
- Reuse the shutdown-aware monitor during in-place add-on update retries so
  service initialization cannot continue after Kodi has begun exiting.
- Recheck shutdown state immediately before starting an automatic scan and
  after a cancelled scan, preventing delayed background work during exit.

## 0.2.24 - 2026-07-26

- Restored the chronological **On this day** home-screen row as a separate choice.
- Added **On this day - random** as an independent home-screen row so either or both can be enabled.
- Explicitly shuffles random On this day results before returning them.
- Keeps nine visible home rows while exposing ten configurable view types.

## 0.2.23 - 2026-07-26

- Keep the chronological **On this day** browser and add a random variant that
  samples matching dates across all earlier years; the Estuary home row now
  uses the random variant without changing saved row settings.
- Apply the configured default album view consistently to interactive picture,
  album, date, camera and keyword browsers while leaving widget layouts to the
  skin.
- Run both full and selected-source manual scans with Kodi's non-modal
  background progress indicator, including pause/resume during playback.
- Advance the picture playlist automatically after an indexed video finishes
  in a mixed slideshow, avoiding the repeated black-screen image-load loop.

## 0.2.22 - 2026-07-25

- Add optional indexing for common home-video formats alongside pictures.
- Add schema 4 with a backward-compatible `pictures.media_type` column and
  index for SQLite and MySQL/MariaDB; existing rows migrate as pictures.
- Add a dedicated Videos browser node and mark video list items playable in
  Kodi while keeping picture-only metadata views unchanged.
- Add database-backed mixed picture/video slideshows using Kodi picture
  playlist 2, including filtered result order and recursive album playback.
- Let minimum-picture-rating policies include videos without assigning fake
  ratings to video records.
- Document video setup, current metadata limitations and cleanup behaviour.
- Reconcile a lowered schema marker with already-recorded later migrations without
  inserting duplicate MySQL/MariaDB migration-history rows.

## 0.2.21 - 2026-07-25

- Always exclude Synology `@eaDir` metadata trees, including directory names
  that end with `@eaDir`, even when an older profile has no matching custom
  exclusion setting.
- Add a General-settings editor for choosing which catalogue browsing nodes are
  visible in the MyPicsDB 3 add-on menu.
- Keep Search, Picture sources, Scan now, Scan status and Settings available so
  catalogue management cannot be hidden accidentally.

## 0.2.20 - 2026-07-25

- Queue the date-sensitive home-screen refresh instead of reloading the skin
  immediately at midnight.
- Wait 60 seconds after the date changes and retry while Kodi is scanning a
  library, playing media, showing a modal dialog, running the screen saver or
  using DPMS.
- Defer the custom Estuary reload until the Home window is active, while other
  skins continue to use a normal container refresh.
- Keep the refresh request pending after transient GUI errors and log when it is
  deferred or completed.

## 0.2.19 - 2026-07-24

- Add skin-independent global search from the MyPicsDB 3 main menu.
- Normalize Unicode search text with NFKC and case folding, retain Swedish
  letters, and require every entered word to match the same picture.
- Search filename, caption, keywords, URI/path parts, camera and stored
  location fields through Query Model version 1 with bound SQL parameters.
- Raise the catalogue to schema 3 with normalized per-picture search documents,
  a retry-safe batch backfill and ongoing scanner maintenance.
- Preserve minimum-rating policy, temporary all-picture browsing and pagination
  across search results on SQLite and MySQL/MariaDB.

## 0.2.18 - 2026-07-24

- Add Query Model version 1 as the shared foundation for future search, smart
  filters, saved views and smart collections without changing database schema 2.
- Strictly validate nested all/any/not groups, bounded values, registered fields,
  operators, scopes and stable sort definitions.
- Compile only trusted SQL fragments with bound parameters for SQLite and
  MySQL/MariaDB, including catalogue page and count execution.
- Add deterministic canonical JSON, minimum-rating-policy control and backend
  parity coverage.

## 0.2.17 - 2026-07-24

- Add **Minimum picture rating** to the Kodi context menu throughout MyPicsDB 3.
- Remove the duplicate **Save current view as album default** entry inside albums.

## 0.2.16 - 2026-07-24

- Add a local minimum-rating display policy without changing database schema 2.
- Distinguish pictures without a stored rating from pictures with explicit rating 0.
- Apply the policy consistently to picture lists, widgets, album counts and artwork,
  date groups, cameras and keywords while leaving scans and stored metadata unchanged.
- Show the active policy in Kodi and allow a temporary all-pictures browsing session.
- Add SQLite coverage and an opt-in MySQL/MariaDB parity test.

## 0.2.15 - 2026-07-23

- Add schema version 2 with an idempotent year-first date-browsing index for
  SQLite and MySQL/MariaDB.
- Change the Years browser to drill down through year, month and day before
  showing pictures.
- Add a No date folder for pictures without an embedded capture date.
- Preserve route parameters on paginated date, camera and keyword views.
- Extend fresh-database, schema-1 upgrade, catalogue, Kodi UI and MariaDB tests.

## 0.2.14 - 2026-07-23

- Align the add-on, repository and core package release versions and update the
  published release notes for the migration foundation.
- Make source verification fail when the add-on, repository and Python package
  versions differ.
- Extend the MariaDB integration test to bootstrap migration history for an
  existing schema-1 catalogue, preserve its data and verify an idempotent rerun.

## 0.2.13 - 2026-07-23

- Add a versioned, checksummed migration runner while retaining schema version 1.
- Register existing schema-1 databases as a baseline only after creating an
  atomic, integrity-checked SQLite backup.
- Refuse newer database schemas before structural writes and coordinate schema
  work with catalogue scans through mutually exclusive locks.
- Add MySQL/MariaDB migration preflight plus read-only current and legacy schema
  inspection tools.
- Document migration design, backup and recovery, and the requirements for the
  first real schema-2 change.

## 0.2.12 - 2026-07-22

- Let the Estuary MyPicsDB 3 home rows load the configured number of items
  instead of always stopping at 15.
- Keep 15 as the default and cap the home-row setting at 50 to limit database,
  artwork and memory overhead.
- Parameterize Estuary's poster widget limit while preserving the standard
  Estuary limit of 15 for every non-MyPicsDB widget.

## 0.2.11 - 2026-07-21

- Stop full foreground scans when Kodi requests shutdown, rather than checking
  only the progress dialog's Cancel button.
- Avoid progress updates, notifications and container refreshes after Kodi has
  begun shutting down for both foreground and selected-source scans.
- Check for cancellation before and after Kodi VFS directory, stat, stream and
  metadata-materialisation operations so a scan stops as soon as a blocked SMB
  call returns.
- Replace the six-hour scan lock with a renewable 30-minute lock. Active scans
  refresh it every minute, while expired locks are never revived.

## 0.2.10 - 2026-07-21

- Replace the failing programmatic home-screen editor with a packaged XML dialog
  and close add-on settings before opening it.
- Fall back to standard Kodi selection dialogs if the visual editor cannot load,
  instead of showing a fatal add-on error.
- Add **Save current view as album default** to the Pictures side menu in the
  generated Estuary MyPicsDB 3 skin and to every item inside an album.
- Bump the patched Estuary skin revisions so Kodi receives the side-menu change.

## 0.2.9 - 2026-07-21

- Replace the nested home-screen configuration menus with a visual nine-row
  editor that shows an On/Off control and move-up/move-down buttons for every
  view.
- Register **Save current view as album default** as a Kodi context-menu item
  while browsing MyPicsDB 3 albums.
- Fall back to a view selector when Kodi cannot report the currently focused
  album view.

## 0.2.8 - 2026-07-21

- Replace the nine separate home-screen row selectors with one ordered editor
  where every view can be enabled, disabled, moved up or moved down.
- Preserve existing home-screen choices and continue writing the legacy row
  settings used by Estuary MyPicsDB 3.
- Add a configurable default view for albums under General settings.
- Add an album context-menu action that saves the currently active view as the
  new album default.

## 0.2.7 - 2026-07-20

- Add independent repository channels for Kodi 21 Omega and Kodi 22 Piers.
- Check the official Kodi releases daily and update pinned Estuary sources only
  after the patch, unit tests, package build and Kodi add-on checker succeed.

  only the newest compatible version to Kodi.
- Preserve the old repository root long enough for installed 0.2.6 repository
  add-ons to update to the new multi-channel configuration.
- Keep the previously published repository history in the generated `repo-data`
  branch used by GitHub Pages.

## 0.2.6 - 2026-07-19

  **On this day** does not remain on the previous day.
- Ask before removing MyPicsDB 3 sources that no longer exist in Kodi, and keep
  declined removals available for the next manual source refresh.

## 0.2.4 - 2026-07-17

- Run **Scan selected source** with Kodi's non-modal background progress indicator.
- Pause selected-source scans during media playback and resume them automatically.
- Keep **Scan now** as the existing foreground, user-cancellable scan.

## 0.2.3

- Keep nine configurable home-screen positions but enable only the first six by default.
- Default Row 7 through Row 9 to None so new installations start with a compact Pictures screen.
- Document safe replacement of a disposable test source with the real picture library.
- Clarify that rows set to None and rows without matching results are not shown.

## 0.2.2

- Fixed missing labels for the General item-limit settings.
- Home screen Row 1 through Row 9 now show their selected or default content.
- Normalized the English gettext catalogue.
- Published skin artwork and screenshots at the paths declared in addon.xml.
